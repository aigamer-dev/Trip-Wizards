## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

If you haven‚Äôt cloned the repository yet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
```

This creates a local copy on your machine.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Feature Branch

Always branch off the `develop` branch:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/chat-ui
```

> **Branch naming convention:** `feature/<task>` or `bugfix/<issue>`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Make Changes Locally

* Edit files, add features, or fix bugs.
* Keep commits **small, logical, and descriptive**.
* Follow the **commit message guidelines**:

```
<type>(scope): short description
```

**Example:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(chat): add real-time messaging feature"
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
```

This creates a **remote branch** for your feature.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to **GitHub ‚Üí Pull Requests ‚Üí New Pull Request**
2. **Base branch:** `develop`
3. **Compare branch:** your feature branch
4. Add a **clear title & description**
5. Link to related issues (`Closes #<issue-number>`)
6. Submit PR for review

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Code Review & Merge

* **1 or 2 team members** review your code
