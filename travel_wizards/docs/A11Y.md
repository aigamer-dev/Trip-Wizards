# Accessibility Checklist

This document outlines the accessibility (a11y) requirements and best practices for the Travel Wizards Flutter application.

## Overview

Accessibility ensures that our app is usable by people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers, voice control, or alternative input methods.

## Checklist Categories

### 🎨 Color & Contrast

- [ ] **Color Contrast**: All text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] **Color Independence**: No information conveyed solely through color (e.g., red/green status indicators)
- [ ] **Dark Mode Support**: App properly supports system dark mode preferences
- [ ] **High Contrast Mode**: App works well in high contrast mode

### 🔊 Semantics & Screen Readers

- [ ] **Semantic Labels**: All interactive elements have meaningful `Semantics` labels or `tooltip` properties
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**: Content is properly announced by screen readers (TalkBack, VoiceOver)
- [ ] **Heading Hierarchy**: Proper heading structure using `Semantics` with `headingLevel`
- [ ] **Image Descriptions**: All images have `alt` text or `Semantics` descriptions
- [ ] **Live Regions**: Dynamic content updates are announced using `Semantics` with `liveRegion`

### ⌨️ Keyboard & Focus

- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- [ ] **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators on all focusable elements
- [ ] **Logical Tab Order**: Tab order follows logical reading order
- [ ] **Focus Trapping**: Modal dialogs properly trap focus
- [ ] **Skip Links**: Skip navigation links for keyboard users (if applicable)

### 📱 Touch & Gesture

- [ ] **Touch Target Size**: All touch targets are at least 44x44dp (48x48dp recommended)
- [ ] **Gesture Alternatives**: Complex gestures have alternative input methods
- [ ] **Touch Feedback**: Visual and haptic feedback for touch interactions
- [ ] **Swipe Actions**: Swipe gestures have clear visual indicators

### 📝 Text & Typography

- [ ] **Readable Fonts**: Use system fonts or well-tested custom fonts
- [ ] **Font Scaling**: Text respects system font size settings
- [ ] **Line Height**: Adequate line spacing (at least 1.5x font size)
- [ ] **Text Spacing**: Supports system text spacing preferences

### 🎯 Forms & Input

- [ ] **Form Labels**: All form fields have associated labels
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Error messages are clearly associated with form fields
- [ ] **Input Hints**: Helpful placeholder text and hints
- [ ] **Field Types**: Appropriate input types (email, phone, etc.) for better keyboard support

### 🔔 Notifications & Alerts

- [ ] **Alert Announcements**: Important alerts are announced by screen readers
- [ ] **Status Messages**: Status updates are properly communicated
- [ ] **Progress Indicators**: Loading states and progress are announced

### 🌐 Internationalization & Localization

- [ ] **RTL Support**: App supports right-to-left languages
- [ ] **Locale Awareness**: Content adapts to user's locale settings
- [ ] **Accessible Translations**: Translated content maintains accessibility

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing

- Run accessibility linting rules in CI/CD pipeline
- Use automated tools like axe-core, WAVE, or Lighthouse for web builds

### Manual Testing

- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS)
- **Keyboard Testing**: Navigate using only Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow keys
- **Color Blind Testing**: Test with different color blindness simulators
- **Font Scaling Testing**: Test with large text settings (200%+)
- **High Contrast Testing**: Test in high contrast mode

### User Testing

- Include users with disabilities in testing phases
- Conduct accessibility audits with experts
- Gather feedback from assistive technology users

## Implementation Guidelines

### Flutter-Specific Best Practices

```dart
// ✅ Good: Semantic labels
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Save'),
  // Add semantic label for screen readers
  semanticsLabel: 'Save your travel preferences',
)

// ✅ Good: Focus management
Focus(
  autofocus: true,
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(
      labelText: 'Email',
      hintText: 'Enter your email address',
    ),
  ),
)

// ✅ Good: Color contrast
Text(
  'Important message',
  style: TextStyle(
    color: Colors.black, // High contrast on light background
    fontSize: 16,
  ),
)
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- ❌ Don't hide focus indicators
- ❌ Don't use very small touch targets
- ❌ Don't ignore screen reader announcements
- ❌ Don't break keyboard navigation
